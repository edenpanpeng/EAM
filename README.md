  Execute around method pattern.

  I first came this pattern from Peter. He told us that whoever created it should destory it. I didn't full understand it that time.
  
  These days, I needed to write someting about data base, so I have to contact it. But I didn't want to just know how to use it. So I tried hard to know it. And I need to thank this website, "http://www.karthikscorner.com/sharepoint/design-patterns-execute-around-method-pattern/".
  
  This pattern, this idea, is amazing. I was attracted to it.
  
  So I wrote this demo yesterday night. And I uploaded it.
